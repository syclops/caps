\subsection{Trust Agility}
\label{sec:background:agility}

The concept of \emph{trust agility} was first described by Moxie Marlinspike in
2011~\cite{marlinspike2011ssl}. Broadly, trust agility covers two main
principles:
\begin{inparaenum}
\item a trust decision can be easily revised at any time, and
\item individual users have the option of deciding where to anchor their trust.
\end{inparaenum}
