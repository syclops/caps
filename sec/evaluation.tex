\subsection{Signaling Mechanism}

We implemented our signal set in \steve{probably C++}. We first compare our
FSA-based approach to other methods, in particular, simply compressing the
signal set and the use of Bloom filters.

\steve{We first eliminated many compression algorithms from consideration by
  considering the Pareto frontier of the compressed size and the decompression
  time. We only compared the decompression time, not the full lookup time,
  because once the set is decompressed, it is the same regardless of compression
algorithm and we would expect the lookup times to be the same.}

We first ask simply how much space the compressed representation of the signal
set takes on disk. We compared
