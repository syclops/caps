Feedback from Paul:

- [9] can be updated to TLS 1.3

- end of section 1: the contributions bullets seem to undersell many of the excellent points made in the Introduction

- there are a few leftover instances of "My" and "my" later in the paper

- Fig.1, could generalize the "Censys" label to "certificate crawler" or something better. Currently unclear what aspect of Censys is being referred to (certificate database?)
