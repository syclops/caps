\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Policy Mechanism}

\draft{We implemented a log that tracks policies. Our code is in \steve{TODO}.
We measured its performance and storage requirements given realistic rates of
new certificates.}

\subsection{Signaling Mechanism}

We implemented our signal set construction in C++.

\draft{We compare our approach to simple compression of the list of deploying
domains, and to succinct encodings of a prefix tree (trie). We measure the
compressed size, memory footprint, and added connection latency.}

\steve{TODO: Add projections on how the metrics will change if there are $n$
deploying domains.}
