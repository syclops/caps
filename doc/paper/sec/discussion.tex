%\textbf{Data Source Integrity.} \ac{name} relies on the integrity of the data
%sources (in our current prototype, Censys, and in the long term, the \ac{ct}
%logs). Therefore, \iac{ca} who issues and publicizes an unauthorized certificate
%for a domain that does not deploy \ac{https} can cause the domain to be included
%in the signal set and thus render the domain inaccessible. This fragility
%effectively allows an adversary to ``poison the well'' that \ac{name} relies on,
%and execute a denial-of-service attack of indefinite duration with just a single
%unauthorized certificate.

%Unfortunately, recovering from such an attack requires immediate action. The
%affected domain could request that the \ac{ca} revoke the certificate if the
%\ac{ca} issued the certificate in error. If the \ac{ca} deliberately misissued
%the certificate, the browser vendor could treat the certificate as revoked
%(though such action is unlikely unless the domain is popular). The affected
%domain could also upgrade to \ac{https}, obtaining enough certificates to
%override the misissued certificate. In the event that the domain wishes to
%remain without \ac{https}, we can allow domains to set a policy flag that
%signals that the domain will communicate over HTTP. The domain, however, must
%still send this policy and proof during connection establishment.

%\textbf{Size of domain names.}
%\begin{compactitem}
%\item What can we do about the large number of domain names?
%\item Ideas
  %\begin{compactitem}
  %\item Have separate FSAs for top sites overall or by country (likely small
    %changes over time)
  %\end{compactitem}
