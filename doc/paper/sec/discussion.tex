\section{Deployment Considerations}
\label{sec:discussion}

We now discuss the deployment of \ac{name} in practice. 
%Specifically, we discuss possible candidates for log aggregators and the expected performance of
%\ac{name} in the modern Web.

\paragraph{Candidates for Log Aggregators}

Our design of \ac{name} does not require specific entities to serve as log
aggregators. However, from our analysis in \autoref{sec:analysis:weaknesses},
we conclude that log aggregators should have high availability and be widely
known. We believe that browser vendors or public logs would be particularly
suited for these roles. Both already take an active role in ``policing'' the
Web PKI: browser vendors can use updates to avoid known compromised
certificates or updates~\cite{langley2012revocation}, and logs already record
certificates that can uncover \ac{ca} malfeasance~\cite{sleevi2015sustaining}.
Both offer high availability, with logs being held to a minimum of 99\%
availability, minimizing the risk of synchronization issues. Finally, lists
of major browser vendors and logs are already widely known, making it easy to
present clients with a list of available log aggregators to provide policy
proofs.

\paragraph{\ac{name} in the Modern Web}

The use of \ac{https} has increased significantly over the past years
(\autoref{sec:evaluation:https}), in part due to the advent of services such as
Let's Encrypt. Despite this increase, we anticipate the 
storage and memory overhead of the \ac{name} signaling set to remain manageable for
three reasons. First, \autoref{tab:sample} suggests a sublinear growth in the
size of the signaling set relative to the number of names. Second, despite
\autoref{fig:count:names} showing a large increase in names for which
certificates are being issued, \autoref{fig:updates} suggests that the growth
of names that are accessible on the public Web is much slower. Finally, the
cost of disk space and memory falls over time offsetting CAPS's overhead.

Many Web clients are now mobile devices with limited
computational, memory, and storage resources, but we can still deploy
\ac{name} on these devices. 
Smaller forms of the signaling set (\autoref{sec:evaluation:implementation}) can
provide some protection against \ac{mitm} attacks on resource-constrained
devices. Moreover, \autoref{fig:numchain} shows the added latency of \ac{name}
is small compared to the overall latency, and is mostly due to validating
additional certificate chains or policy proofs.
