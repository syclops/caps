\section{Deployment Considerations}
\label{sec:discussion}

We now discuss potential issues related to the deployment of \ac{name} in
practice, and propose possible ways to address them.
%Specifically, we discuss possible candidates for log aggregators and the expected performance of
%\ac{name} in the modern Web.

\paragraph{Candidates for Log Aggregators}
Our design of \ac{name} does not require specific entities to serve as log
aggregators. However, from our analysis in \autoref{sec:analysis:weaknesses},
we conclude that log aggregators should have high availability and be widely
known. We believe that browser vendors or public logs would be particularly
suited for these roles. Both already take an active role in ``policing'' the
Web PKI. 
%browser vendors can use updates to avoid known compromised
%certificates or updates~\cite{langley2012revocation}, and logs already record
%certificates that can uncover \ac{ca} malfeasance~\cite{sleevi2015sustaining}.
Both offer high availability, with logs being held to a minimum of 99\%
availability, minimizing the risk of synchronization issues. Finally, lists
of major browser vendors and logs are already widely known, making it easy to
present clients with a list of available log aggregators to provide policy
proofs.

\paragraph{Independent Certificate Chains}
In \autoref{sec:design:policy} we described how we can use a graph of certificate
fingerprints to compute the policy value for a domain. Specifically, we compute
the policy value as the minimum number of \ac{ca} private keys that would need
to be compromised to create an independent set of certificate chains for an
adversary's public key. However, this value does not necessarily result in truly
independent certificate chains, as many \acp{ca} control multiple private keys.
If a single \ac{ca} with poor issuance practices possesses multiple private
keys, an adversary may gain fraudulent certificates from multiple private keys
in a single attack. If these certificates are in multiple independent chains,
then an adversary may be able to mount \iac{mitm} attack.

One solution to this vulnerability is to use the certificate's issuer
organization name to differentiate \acp{ca}, but the success of this approach
depends on the \ac{ca} itself. As we describe in
\autoref{sec:evaluation:updates}, we found certificates that are likely from the
same issuer, but have slightly different issue organization names. Furthermore,
one \acp{ca} may own another and use similar security practices. If these
\acp{ca} do not certify one another, their certificate chains may be considered
independent by log aggregators. While we leave deeper exploration of this area
to future work, we can easily configure \ac{name} to determine the independence
of certificate chains by the issuer key or organization name, and this is likely
to provide sufficient security for the vast majority of cases.

\paragraph{\ac{name} in the Modern Web}
The use of \ac{https} has increased significantly over the past years
(\autoref{sec:evaluation:https}), in part due to the advent of services such as
Let's Encrypt. Despite this increase, we anticipate the 
storage and memory overhead of the \ac{name} signaling set to remain manageable for
three reasons. First, \autoref{tab:sample} suggests a sublinear growth in the
size of the signaling set relative to the number of names. Second, despite
\autoref{fig:count:names} showing a large increase in certified names, 
\autoref{fig:updates} suggests that the growth
of names that are accessible on the public Web is much slower. Finally, the
cost of disk space and memory falls over time, offsetting CAPS's overhead.

Many Web clients are now mobile devices with limited
computational, memory, and storage resources, but we can still deploy
\ac{name} on these devices. 
Smaller forms of the signaling set (\autoref{sec:evaluation:implementation}) can
provide some protection against \ac{mitm} attacks on resource-constrained
devices. Moreover, \autoref{fig:numchain} shows the added latency of \ac{name}
is small compared to the overall latency, and is mostly due to validating
additional certificate chains or policy proofs.
