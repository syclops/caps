\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we described how \ac{name} provides for a secure, smooth
transition to a more resilient Web \ac{pki}. By using a global view of Web
certificates provided by Internet-wide scanning and logging, \ac{name} can
prevent \ac{tls} stripping and downgrade attacks that will inevitably arise
during the deployment of a more secure Web \ac{pki}. Moreover, by leveraging
data compression and existing functionality in \ac{tls}, we can provide this
service to clients with modest overhead. While there are still ways to further
improve upon the work we presented here, \ac{name} addresses critical
challenges and provides an important step towards a resilient Web \ac{pki}.
