\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We described how \ac{name} provides for a secure, smooth
transition to a more resilient Web \ac{pki}. Using a global view of Web
certificates, % provided by Internet-wide scanning and logging, 
\ac{name} prevents \ac{tls} stripping and downgrade attacks
with modest overhead, thanks to
data compression and existing TLS functionality.
\ac{name}' flexible policy approach simplifies incremental deployment
and recovery from errors.
While room for improvement remains,
\ac{name} addresses critical challenges and provides an important step towards a resilient Web \ac{pki}.
