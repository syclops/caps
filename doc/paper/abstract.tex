Many recent proposals to increase the resilience of the Web PKI against
misbehaving CAs face significant obstacles to deployment. These hurdles include
(1) the requirement of drastic changes to the existing PKI players and their
interactions through many new roles and protocols, (2) the lack of a signaling
mechanism(s) that protect against downgrade attacks, and (3) the presence of
inflexible mechanisms that hinder recovery from misconfiguration or the loss or
compromise of private keys. As a result, despite their contributions to
improving the security of the Web PKI, few of these proposals have seen
widespread deployment, and many lack a viable deployment strategy. To address
this roadblock, we propose Certificates with Automated Policies and Signaling
(CAPS), a system that enables a seamless and secure transition from today's
insecure Web PKI. CAPS leverages the infrastructure of the existing Web PKI to
overcome the aforementioned hurdles, and also enables the incremental deployment
of present and future proposals to improve the Web PKI. Through our design and
implementation of CAPS, we show that it is possible to strengthen the existing
PKI, and to set the stage for deploying new and improved PKI proposals in a
practical and feasible way, despite the weaknesses of the current Web PKI.
