% Replace the following information with your document's actual
% metadata. If you do not want to set a value for a certain parameter,
% just omit it.
%
% Symbols permitted in metadata
% =============================
% 
% Within the metadata, all printable ASCII characters except
% '\', '{', '}', and '%' represent themselves. Also, all printable
% Unicode characters from the basic multilingual plane (i.e., up to
% code point U+FFFF) can be used directly with the UTF-8 encoding. 
% Consecutive whitespace characters are combined into a single
% space. Whitespace after a macro such as \copyright, \backslash, or
% \sep is ignored. Blank lines are not permitted. Moreover, the
% following markup can be used:
%
%  '\ '         - a literal space  (for example after a macro)                  
%   \%          - a literal '%'                                                 
%   \{          - a literal '{'                                                 
%   \}          - a literal '}'                                                 
%   \backslash  - a literal '\'                                                 
%   \copyright  - the (c) copyright symbol                                      
%
% The macro \sep is only permitted within \Author, \Keywords, and
% \Org.  It is used to separate multiple authors, keywords, etc.
% 
% List of supported metadata fields
% =================================
% 
% Here is a complete list of user-definable metadata fields currently
% supported, and their meanings. More may be added in the future.
% 
% General information:

%                      authors with \sep.
%  \Title            - the document's title.
%  \Keywords         - list of keywords, separated with \sep.
%  \Subject          - the abstract. 
%  \Org              - publishers.
% 
% Copyright information:
%
%  \Copyright        - a copyright statement.
%  \CopyrightURL     - location of a web page describing the owner
%                      and/or rights statement for this document.
%  \Copyrighted      - 'True' if the document is copyrighted, and
%                      'False' if it isn't. This is automatically set
%                      to 'True' if either \Copyright or \CopyrightURL
%                      is specified, but can be overridden. For
%                      example, if the copyright statement is "Public
%                      Domain", this should be set to 'False'.
%
% Publication information:
%
% \PublicationType   - The type of publication. If defined, must be
%                      one of book, catalog, feed, journal, magazine,
%                      manual, newsletter, pamphlet. This is
%                      automatically set to "journal" if \Journaltitle
%                      is specified, but can be overridden.
% \Journaltitle      - The title of the journal in which the document
%                      was published. 
% \Journalnumber     - The ISSN for the publication in which the
%                      document was published.
% \Volume            - Journal volume.
% \Issue             - Journal issue/number.
% \Firstpage         - First page number of the published version of
%                      the document.
% \Lastpage          - Last page number of the published version of
%                      the document.
% \Doi               - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the
%                      document, without the leading "doi:".
% \CoverDisplayDate  - Date on the cover of the journal issue, as a
%                      human-readable text string.
% \CoverDate         - Date on the cover of the journal issue, in a
%                      format suitable for storing in a database field
%                      with a 'date' data type.

\Subject      {Many recent proposals to increase the resilience of the Web PKI against misbehaving CAs face significant obstacles to deployment. These hurdles include (1) the requirement of drastic changes to the existing PKI players and their interactions, (2) the lack of signaling mechanisms to protect against downgrade attacks, (3) the lack of an incremental deployment strategy, and (4) the use of inflexible mechanisms that hinder recovery from misconfiguration or from the loss or compromise of private keys. As a result, few of these proposals have seen widespread deployment, despite their promise of a more secure Web PKI. To address these roadblocks, we propose Certificates with Automated Policies and Signaling (CAPS), a system that leverages the infrastructure of the existing Web PKI to overcome the aforementioned hurdles. CAPS offers a seamless and secure transition away from todayâ€™s insecure Web PKI and towards present and future proposals to improve the Web PKI. Crucially, with CAPS, domains can take simple steps to protect themselves from MITM attacks in the presence of one or more misbehaving CAs, and yet the interaction between domains and CAs remains fundamentally the same. We implement CAPS and show that it adds at most 5% to connection establishment latency.}
