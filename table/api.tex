  \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Use}\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{submit-entry}
  & submit a certificate or precertificate (described below) along with a
  certificate chain to the log for inclusion.\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{get-sth}
  & retrieve a signed and timestamped copy of the latest root hash of the log's
  Merkle hash tree, called \iac{sth}.\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{get-sth-consistency}
  & retrieve a consistency proof given two \acp{sth} of the log.\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{get-proof-by-hash}
  & retrieve an inclusion proof for a given leaf hash and desired Merkle hash
  tree size (representing the state of a log at a given point).\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{get-all-by-hash}
  & retrieve an inclusion proof, \ac{sth}, and consistency proof given a leaf
  hash and desired tree size.\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{get-entries}
  & given a start and end index, retrieve a range of entries (including the
  certificate and their \acp{sct}) as well as the latest \ac{sth}.\\
  \midrule
  \texttt{get-anchors}
  & retrieve a list of the trust anchors of the log (that is, the set of
  certificates that all submitted certificate chains must be rooted in).\\
